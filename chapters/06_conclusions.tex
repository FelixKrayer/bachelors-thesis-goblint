\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chapter:conclusions}
  In this thesis we introduced static analysis with systems of constraints. After expanding the approach to interprocedural analysis with various kinds of context-sensitivity, we identified a source of precision loss that can occur with context-insensitive and partially context-sensitive analyses. In the following two chapters we focused on two different kinds of analyses, where this loss of precision occurs and proposed an improvement that reduces the precision lost for both kinds. We implemented both of our proposed approaches in the \gob\ analyzer. Afterwards we tested and benchmarked our implementation.\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Summary:}
  \item Source of Precison loss identified
  \item Two ideas for reducing the precision loss for two types of analyses
  \item implemented in \gob\ and tested to prove viability
  \item benchmarked to check if a noticeable improvement is achieved
  \item \textbf{Conclusions:}
  \item => result: little improvement, but not time costly???
  \item -> future: more extensive benchmark for thread Create
  \item -> future: Not that great???
\end{itemize}
