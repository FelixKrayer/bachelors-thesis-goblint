First we will introduce the basics of static analysis. This will go by introducing constraint systems and how these are used to gain information about the program statically. It will be accompanied by an example of a value-of-variables analysis acting on a toy language we will use for examples in this thesis. This will be extended to an interprocedural approach where partial context sensitivity will be introduced. Here the source of the precision loss will be pointed out. We then will propose an approach to combat this precision loss. The approach will first be introduced theoretically, after which we also present the challenges and results of implementing it in the \Gob analyzer. To give an evaluation to the proposed approach, a benchmark of the implementation will be performed and inspected. Our conclusions are presented in the last chapter.
% TODO later: Examples or single example
